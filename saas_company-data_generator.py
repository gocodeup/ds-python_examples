# 2. Find the top 5 largest customer defection events.
# 3. Given the model's parameters on growth, what is the maximum size of this SaaS business? When will the business reach this maximum?
# 4. How does the growth of the cohort of customers with odd Customer_Ids who signed-up within the first 6 periods compare to the similar cohort of evenly-numbered Customer_Ids? Present your results both as an A/B test and a plot.
